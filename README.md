Recipes website project 

This project consist of creating a website with some food recipes.

Creating this website will help me put in practice what I've learned in the TOP Foundation about HTML, like using some basic tags, putting some images and using links to connect the different web pages.

Once finished, I will have improved my understanding on how to correctly make a basic website structure. And I will have made my very first website. ðŸ˜„
