    <h2>Spanish tortilla de patatas "potatoe's tortilla"</h2>
    <p>Tortilla de patatas or Tortilla Española as
        it is known in Spain, is one of the most 
        iconic dishes in the Spanish gastronomy.
        It is the favorite dish of many people,
        not only because it's really easy to make,
        but is also a very delicious plate. Spaniards love it!
    </p>
    <p>To make a good Tortilla Española all you need is
        some <strong>eggs</strong>, a couple of <strong>
        potatoes</strong> and some <strong>olive oil</strong>
        <em>(and a little practice)</em>.
         You can also throw some chopped onion on it, 
        in fact there's a national argument with some
        people saying onion makes it better and others
        saying they prefer it without it. But to make 
        things simpler we will avoid using onion in this 
        recipe.
        It is also very important to have a good pan
        because otherwise it will be tricky to flip 
        the tortilla. You can use more or less Ingredients
        depending on the pan size you're going to use. Here
        we will use a small pan.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>3 small potatoes</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and cut potatoes in very thin slices and
            put in the pan with enough olive oil to soak them. 
            Heat over medium heat. 
        </li>
        <li>Add salt, and stir so the potatoes don't stick
            to the pan. Cook untill potato start to be softer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack and mix the eggs in a bowl, add some salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the potato start to fall apart, remove it.
            Put it in the eggs bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure nothing is left in the pan, or use
            another pan. Add some olive oil, enough to spread
            it over the pan (including the internal 
            walls of the pan). Heat over high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the pan is hot, add the eggs and potatoes. The
            mix should almost fill the whole pan. Change to
            medium-low heat. Use a spatula
            to avoid the eggs sticking to the pan on the sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            After couple minutes, when the eggs start to set, flip
            the tortilla. You can use a plate to
            turn it over. When you feel the tortilla is cooked
            enough so it doesn't fall apart, you can serve it.
        </li>
    </ol>
